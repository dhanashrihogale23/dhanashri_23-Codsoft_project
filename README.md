Codsoft Internship project repository Task list:

Task-1> TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION:
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Task-2> CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

Task-3> IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Task-4>SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON :
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such asadvertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, andadvertising platform selection. In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a DataScientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machinelearning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowingthem to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. Byleveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark onthe journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.

Task-5>MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON:
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
